We are using specific popIII model data.
This folder contains information about the data for this project:
We have of posteriors of observed events with LISA, as well as True astrophysical Model data

[we focus on Total redshifted mass and Luminosity distance or redshift(Planck15 cosmo)]

We have three types of plots

1: intrinsic astrophysical events data plots (assuming we know true distribution and have the parameters of those.)

2: observed events (injected) true parameters plots are true values of observed samples

3: PE plots are parameter estimation results plots [with and without lensing effects]
